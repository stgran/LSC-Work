# Preparing Eviction Data for Visualization in Tableau
This code is designed to prepare court data for visualization with Tableau.

This code reorganizes eviction case data scraped from court websites into chronologically-organized counts of evictions. 

This data is organized into yearly columns and broken down by either week or month.

This code has functionality to prepare data into three formats: weekly, monthly, and cumulative monthly.

The CSVs outputted by this code should be ready for direct upload to Tableau for visualization.

The .py and .ipynb files are identical to each other.
