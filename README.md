# LSC-Work

I worked for Legal Services Corporation twice: most recently as a Data Engineer in ODGA from July 2022 through August 2023, and previously as an Intern in the Office of Data Governance and Analysis (ODGA) from September 2020 through May 2021.  

This repository contains code samples from my time as a Data Engineer and as an Intern.  
 
- The `data-engineer_2022-2023` directory contains code samples selected to demonstrate the various types of work I did as a Data Engineer. As a DE, my responsibilities, among other things, included expanding the range of our web scraping of court records websites by adding new Python scrapers, improving our ETL infrastructure using SQL and DBT, and conducting analyses using R of the court records data we had collected.  
- The `intern_2020-2021` directory contains the main code projects I worked on as an Intern.
